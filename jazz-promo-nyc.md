## Alliance Offerings

- An alliance is where there are clear terms of reciprocation between our team and a given organization.  
- We will be offering alliances of many kinds to a wide variety of New York City jazz-related organizations.
- Every NYC jazz community organization gets a taste of free benefits so that they get before they are asked to give.  
- Each alliance includes both on-the-street and online goals for all community organizations.
